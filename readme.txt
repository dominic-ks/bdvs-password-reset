== Description ==

A simple plugin that adds a password reset facility to the WordPress REST API using a code. The process is a two step process:

1. User requests a password reset. A 4 digit code is emailed to their registered email address
2. The user enters the code when setting a new password, which is only set if the code is valid and has not expired

It is also possible to check the validity of a code without resetting the password which enables the possibility of setting the password by other means, or having a two stage process for checking the code and resetting the password if desired.

Default settings are to use a 4 digit numerical code which has a life span of 15 minutes, afterwhich a new code would need to be requested.

## Endpoints

The plugin adds two new endpoints to the REST API:

 - Endpoint: */wp-json/bdpwr/v1/reset-password*
 -- HTTP Verb: POST
 -- Parameters (**all required**):
 --- email

 - */wp-json/bdpwr/v1/set-password*
 -- HTTP Verb: POST
 -- Parameters (**all required**):
 --- email
 --- password
 --- code

 - */wp-json/bdpwr/v1/validate-code*
 -- HTTP Verb: POST
 -- Parameters (**all required**):
 --- email
 --- code
